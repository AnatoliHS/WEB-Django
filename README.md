# Startr/WEB-Django

## v0.0.0

Welcome to the foundation of Startr/WEB-Django.

Back in the early stages of this project, we needed something simple, quick, and effective. One early morning with some great coffee and love, we crafted a clean Docker image that spins up instantly and works like a charm. 

## Run it with:

`bash <(curl -sL startr.sh) run`

This command mounts your project directory into /project, making it easy to jump straight into the code without delay. You’ll appreciate how fast this setup is for development—saving time when it matters most.

We've kept things lean and efficient, just how we like it. No bloat, no fuss, just pure productivity. If you’ve ever struggled to get environments up and running smoothly, this setup will feel like a breath of fresh air.
